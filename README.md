# Log Analyzer

## Purpose
This script analyzes log files to extract and summarize important information, such as error counts or specific events. It will output the error summary to `error_summary.txt` so that it may be reviewed later and in a comprehensive manner. It is useful for system administrators who need to monitor server logs and identify potential issues quickly.
